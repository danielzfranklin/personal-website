    Chicken a Day is a small project I made to teach myself the basics of Google App Engine and Mandrill. If you sign up, every morning you will wake up to a marvelous chicken picture in your inbox that has been selected with care by my automated system from the endless reserve of chicken pictures on Flickr.
