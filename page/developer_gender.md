title: Looking At Developer Gender Data
order: 0

I was looking at the [Stack Exchange 2015 Developer
Survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015), and downloaded
the data so that I could examine it more in Python. I was interested in how the
developer gender breakup looked, so I made [some
graphs](/project/developer_gender). Nothing (sadly) was shocking, 4.7% of
developers in the United States self-reported as female, and worldwide 6% of
back-end developers self-reported as female to 10.2% of front-end developers. On
a lighter note, while 45% of all developers said they prefer tabs over spaces,
more experienced users overwhelmingly preferred spaces [^tabs_v_spaces]. You can
download the data yourself from [google
drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzd_CzYvUxE5U1NSWnA2SFVKX00/view).
