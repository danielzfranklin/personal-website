title: Looking At Developer Gender Data
order: 0

I was looking at the [Stack Exchange 2015 Developer
Survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015), and downloaded
the data so that I could examine it more in Python. I was interested in how the
developer gender breakup looked, so I made [some
graphs][charts]. Nothing (sadly) was shocking. 4.7% of
developers in the United States self-reported as female. Worldwide, 6% of
back-end developers self-reported as female to 10.2% of front-end developers.
You can download the entire dataset yourself from [google
drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzd_CzYvUxE5U1NSWnA2SFVKX00/view) or
[view some pie charts I made out of part of the data][charts].
