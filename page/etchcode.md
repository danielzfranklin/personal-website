[Etch Code][website] is a work-in-progress attempt by [Sam
Schickler](http://samschickler.com/) and I to make the transition between
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and a written language easier. Etch Code is
all the same Scratch blocks that people are used to, except the blocks are
written instead of images. For example:

    flag clicked:
        say("Hello World")

It's not quite functional at this point, but there is a semi-working site up at
[etchcode.org][website]
