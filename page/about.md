I'm Daniel, a high school student who lives in Kensington, California. In my free time I
program websites and read books.

Some of my favorite books are [The
Sparrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sparrow_(novel)) by Mary Doria
Russell, [A Woman in Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Woman_in_Berlin)
likely by Marta Hillers, [All Quiet on the Western
Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front) by Erich
Maria Remarque, [Startide Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startide_Rising)
by David Brin, [Glory Season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory_Season) by
David Brin and [the Foundation
Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) by Isaac Asimov.
