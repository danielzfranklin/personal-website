            <p>I was playing around with the
                <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015">
                    Stack Overflow 2015 Developer Survey
                </a>
                and created this to display the gender breakup in a bit more detail
                than is on the stackexchange summary. The survey was of users
                of the most popular developer question and answer site, and had 26,086
                responses. All data was self-reported.
