    I'm a high school student in Berkeley, California. My two favorite pastimes are programming and reading books.

    <md-subheader>Etch Code</md-subheader>
    <a href="http://etchcode.org">Etch Code</a> is a work-in-progress attempt by <a href="http://samschickler.com/">Sam Schickler</a> and I to make the transition between Scratch and a written language easier. Etch Code is all the same Scratch blocks as people are used to, except the blocks are written instead of images. For example:
    
    <img class="etch_vs_scratch_image" src="http://etchcode.org/static/images/comparing-scratch-and-etch-hello-world.png">
    
    It's not quite functional at this point, but there is a semi-working site up at <a href="http://etchcode.org">etchcode.org</a>.

    Chicken a Day is a small project I made to learn the basics of Google App Engine and Mandrill. If you sign up, every morning you will wake up to a marvelous chicken picture in your inbox that has been selected with care by my automated system from the endless reserve of chicken pictures on Flickr. <a href="http://chickenaday.appspot.com">chickenaday.appspot.com</a>.
